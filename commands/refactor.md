# Code Refactoring

Systematic approach to improving code quality through structural improvements while preserving functionality.

## Process Overview

**1. Initial Assessment**
- Check current branch status and compare with main
- Identify code complexity indicators:
  - Functions longer than 20 lines
  - Nested conditionals (3+ levels)
  - Duplicated code blocks
  - Complex boolean expressions
  - Magic numbers or unclear variable names

**2. Analysis and Planning**
- Search codebase first to understand existing patterns and conventions
- Use @code-simplifier to analyze the codebase and identify specific refactoring opportunities
- Prioritize improvements by impact: readability, maintainability, performance
- Plan atomic refactoring steps to avoid breaking changes
- Use parallel execution for independent analysis tasks (file reads, pattern searches)

**3. Apply Refactoring Techniques**
- **Eliminate redundancy**: Extract common logic, apply DRY principle
- **Reduce complexity**: Use guard clauses, early returns, break down large functions
- **Modernize syntax**: Leverage built-in features and idiomatic expressions
- **Improve structure**: Apply SOLID principles, enhance separation of concerns
- **Enhance error handling**: Add meaningful error messages for all scenarios
- **Strengthen typing**: Avoid loose types, use specific types throughout

**4. Validation**
- **CRITICAL**: Never modify existing tests - only run them to validate refactored code
- Test thoroughly using existing test suite to ensure functionality is preserved
- Validate through TDD approach - all tests must continue to pass
- Run lint and build checks to ensure code quality standards
- Verify no regressions introduced through parallel validation checks

**5. Commit Changes**
- Make atomic commits for each logical refactoring unit
- Follow conventional commits format:
  - Commit message title must be entirely lowercase
  - Title must be less than 50 characters  
  - Use format: refactor: description of improvement
- Push changes to remote repository

## Refactoring Focus Areas
- Extract methods from long functions
- Replace magic numbers with named constants
- Simplify conditional logic
- Remove code duplication
- Improve naming conventions
- Apply modern language features
