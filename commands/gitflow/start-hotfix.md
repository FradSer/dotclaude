# Start Hotfix

Start new hotfix or continue existing hotfix development.

## Overview

Creates hotfix branch from main or switches to existing hotfix:
- No existing branches: Create new hotfix with incremented patch version
- Branch exists: Switch to existing branch

## Usage

```bash
# Create new hotfix
git flow hotfix start [version]

# Continue existing hotfix
git checkout hotfix/[version]
```

## What It Does

1. Detects existing hotfix branches
2. Creates new hotfix from main with incremented patch version (1.2.3 â†’ 1.2.4)
3. Updates version files (package.json, pyproject.toml)
4. Switches to existing hotfix if found

## Best Practices
- Focus on critical bug fixes only
- Use conventional commits (fix:, chore:)
- Test fixes thoroughly
- Keep changes minimal
