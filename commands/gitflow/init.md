# Git Flow Initialization

Initialize git-flow in an existing repository with default branch conventions.

```bash
git flow init
```

This command:
- Sets up git-flow configuration
- Establishes branch naming conventions
- Creates the develop branch if it doesn't exist
- Configures main/master as production branch and develop as integration branch

Use default values when prompted for branch names to maintain consistency across projects.
