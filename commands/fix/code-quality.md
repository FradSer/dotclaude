# Code Quality Fix

Use @code-reviewer to identify issues, then @code-simplifier to implement fixes for code quality, performance, and testing coverage focusing on naming conventions, algorithm efficiency, test completeness, and error handling patterns.

1. **@code-reviewer** - Analyze code quality issues
2. **Implement security fixes** - Address identified vulnerabilities
3. **@code-simplifier** - Implement fixes and refactoring 
4. **Run tests** - Validate changes don't break functionality
5. **Commit and push** - Create descriptive commit message following requirements:
   - Commit message title must be entirely lowercase
   - Title must be less than 50 characters
   - Follow conventional commits format (feat:, fix:, chore:, etc.)
   - Use atomic commits for logical units of work

For performance optimization changes, core algorithms, shared utilities, and test suite updates.
