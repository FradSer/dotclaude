# Quick Fix

Use @tech-lead-reviewer for rapid assessment, then appropriate agents for targeted fixes.

1. **@tech-lead-reviewer** - Assess change scope and identify issues
2. **Apply targeted fixes** - Use @code-reviewer, @code-simplifier, or @security-reviewer as needed
3. **Test changes** - Run relevant tests  
4. **Commit and push** - Document fixes in commit message

For small bug fixes, simple features, formatting, documentation, tests, and configuration changes.
