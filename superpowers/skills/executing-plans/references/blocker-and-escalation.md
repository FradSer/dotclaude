# Executing Plans Details (2/2)

## Remember
- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Between batches: just report and wait
- Stop when blocked, don't guess

- Never start implementation on main/master branch without explicit user consent
