## Consistency

**Impact: LOW (Project health)**

Be consistent. If you are editing existing code, take a few minutes to look at the code around you and determine its style. If they use spaces around all their arithmetic operators, you should too. If their comments have little boxes of asterisks around them, yours should too.

The point of having style guidelines is to have a common vocabulary of coding so people can concentrate on what you are saying rather than on how you are saying it.
